After quite some time with no released updates to Puzzlr and very little development
going on, we're pleased to say we are going to be restarting development of Puzzlr. This 
new version will be a clean state. We won't use the Portal cube at all, instead we'll be 
using a Hammer-created cube that requires no additional content. We'll be keeping with 
our previous idea of minimal requirements for the mod and that will most likely continue 
to hold true. This project is know proceeding as an Open Source project which has all of 
the content of the new version available on our Google Code page here. All of the code is
licensed under the MIT license which grants users the ability to use, copy, modify,
merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of Puzzlr. Although to be
quite honest, we would definitely prefer if our code and game was not sold as is without
any modification. That being said, you're still able to do it. This new version of Puzzlr
is based not on Half-Life 2 : Deathmatch but instead on a Multiplayer Mod template from
the Source SDK. With an SVN server set up through Google Code, our development will be
much more efficient and as a result releases will come much faster. More advanced users
will also be able to compile newer versions for themselves although we cannot guarantee
this will work nor can we guarantee that you'll have any better of a playing experience.
In summary, Puzzlr is back and will be better than ever with an all new engine and all 
new maps.
